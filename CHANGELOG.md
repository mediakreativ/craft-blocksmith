## [1.4.1] - 2025-04-23

### Fixed
- ‚ÄúAdd block above‚Äù now works correctly in Cards view when ‚ÄúShow cards in a grid‚Äù is enabled.

## [1.4.0] - 2025-04-21

This release brings **full Cards view compatibility** to Blocksmith, making it the first plugin to support true context-aware editing for Matrix fields using the ‚ÄúCards‚Äù view mode ‚Äì including the ability to add blocks above existing ones, a feature not natively available in Craft CMS.

### Added
- **Full Cards View compatibility**: Bring context-aware editing to the Cards view ‚Äì including the unique ability to add blocks above existing ones, a feature not natively supported by Craft.

## [1.2.7] - 2025-03-30

  - Blocksmith now listens for Matrix field creation and automatically inserts the required DB record for preview support.

## [1.1.0-beta] - 2024-12-11

### Highlights
