## [1.1.0-beta] - 2024-12-11

### Highlights
This release introduces the **flexible image upload for block previews** and makes the **Block Settings page** under "Configure Blocks" fully functional. Additionally, significant improvements to the user experience have been made, including the ability to choose between handle-based and uploaded preview images.

### Added
- **Flexible Preview Images for Blocks:**: In addition to handle-based preview images, users can now upload custom preview images directly via the Craft Asset Browser. Both handle-based and custom preview images are supported, offering greater flexibility in managing block previews.
- **Block Settings Page:**: The "Configure Blocks" section is now fully functional, allowing users to manage block descriptions and, if handle-based previews are disabled, upload or modify preview images.
- **Preview Modal Improvements:**: Added an option to display 3 blocks per row in wide viewports (â‰¥1178px). The default remains 2 blocks per row.

### Improved
- **Usability:**: Automatic selection of a default volume for handle-based preview images prevents misconfigurations.
- **Performance:**: Improved AJAX requests for fetching and displaying block data and preview images, ensuring a faster and more reliable experience.

### Fixed
- Resolved an issue where handle-based preview images were not recognized if no volume was selected.
- Minor UI issues on the Block Settings page have been addressed.
