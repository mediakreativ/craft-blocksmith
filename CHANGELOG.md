## 1.0.0 (Beta)

## Initial beta release with:
- **Modal for intuitive block selection**: Users can easily browse and add blocks via a user-friendly modal interface.
- **Enhanced block selection via context menu**: A dedicated "Add block above" button is available in the context menu, replacing native individual buttons for every entry type (e.g., "Add xyz above").
- **Block previews with fallback support**: Displays preview images for blocks, with a placeholder for missing previews.
- **Dynamic settings for preview image volumes and subfolders**: Customize the storage location for block preview images.
- **Translation support**: Currently available in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Russian, and Ukrainian.
- **Current limitation**: Block preview images must currently be named after their handle and placed in the configured asset volume. This workaround will soon be replaced with a dedicated file upload feature in the plugin settings.
